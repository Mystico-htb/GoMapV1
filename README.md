TerminalJockey/MrBreadcrumbs here to wish everyone a wonderful New Year as we Y33T 2019 into the sun!
This tool was written in the spirit of learning, and partially because I have seen a lot of talk about 
offensive security tools being dangerous and some people calling for a need to limit their distribution.
As someone working in security research, the lack of free and open source tools would severely handicap
my work, UNLESS I COULD WRITE MY OWN. So this is my attempt at doing so. Picked up go a few days ago and
with a healthy(ish) dose of caffeine here we are. I plan on adding implementation for threading and possibly
a rudimentary version scan a la nmap -sV. Go has been a dream to learn so expect more goodies soon. 
may get a blog post going of what I researched to learn to write this so anyone with a bit of time and 
dedication can start writing their own tools as well!
